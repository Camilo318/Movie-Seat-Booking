# Movie-Seat-Booking
A simple interface to choose and buy movie tickets.

OOP was heavily used in this project.
Each movie has its own seats, so you can switch between movies and the selected and occupied spots will remain for that movie.
Very similar when you went to the movies and the lady showed you all the free spots on her little screen. Ah man.. I miss going to the movies ðŸ˜ª
